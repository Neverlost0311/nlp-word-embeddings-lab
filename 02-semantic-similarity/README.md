# Lab 2: Semantic Similarity with Embeddings

## Goal

Learn how to measure **semantic similarity** between words and sentences using vector embeddings and cosine similarity.

In this lab, we will:

- Generate embeddings using Gemini
- Implement cosine similarity from scratch
- Compare:
  - word vs word
  - sentence vs sentence
- Build a mini **semantic search engine**
- Understand how machines compare meanings, not just words

## What you will build

- A similarity function
- A comparison tool for any two texts
- A small semantic search over multiple sentences

## Status
